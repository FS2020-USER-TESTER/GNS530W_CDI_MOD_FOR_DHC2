# GNS530W_CDI_MOD_FOR_DHC2 (BEAVER)
This mod changes the Got Friends mod for DHC-2 to improve compatibility with WT provided GNS530W including split CDI.

**BETA - THIS MOD IS RELEASED AS BETA FOR END-USER TESTING. EXPECT ADDITIONAL UPDATES.**

## Install

1. Confirm Got Friends Dhc-3-Beaver-action-pack from https://flightsim.to/file/43824/dhc-2-beaver-action-pack is installed  
2. Unzip WtGNS530-Fix-CDI-Milviz-DHC2.zip into community folder
3. This mod is only functional while flying the Got Friends mod. Use without that mod is not recomended.

## Using External Controls for GNS530:

1. Users that map GNS530/430 to external buttons need to assign the CDI button to a script. Here is a possible script (tested with AAO):

* 1 (>H:AS530_CDI_Push, Number)

## Features provided by the mod:

1. There is a GNS530 and a GNS430 available in the DHC-2. With this mod the units can be in unmatched CDI states - one in VLOC and one in GPS
2. Improvements to the Dual Radio mode of the panel to avoid HSI incorrect due to hidden GPS state.
3. The latest core fix for autopilot startup PID reset is enabled. This can provide smoother autopilot startup. It is suggested that pilot trim the aircraft before engaging the AP for smoothest transition.

## Usable with both GNS530 mods:

1. The primary target of this add-on mode is the WT GNS530W mod installed from marketplace.
2. The mod from pms50.com can also be used and split CDI should be functional.
